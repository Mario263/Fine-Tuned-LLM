    "\n",
    "In the previous session, we explored the foundational concepts behind training and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). Here's a brief summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLMs operate on sequences of integers known as *tokens*. Given a sequence, they predict the probability distribution of the next token in the sequence.\n",
    "* The first phase of training an LLM is called **pretraining**. This involves training the model on a massive corpus of unlabeled text data.\n",
    "* The output of pretraining is a **base model**, which has learned general language patterns but isn‚Äôt specialized for specific tasks.\n",
    "* To adapt the base model for a particular use case‚Äîlike building a chatbot‚Äîwe need to **fine-tune** (or post-train) it on a dataset of conversations.\n",
    "* Many high-quality conversational datasets are available publicly on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets).\n",
    "* These datasets are often not in a format that's directly usable for training, so **data preprocessing** is usually required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we're on the same page, let's dive into the next session! First Let's load our base model and tokenizer. \n",

So, it's important to control this maximum sequence length, and truncate any sequences that exceed it.\n",
